title: Ocho Rules

<h1>Rules</h1>
<hr>
<p>The rules to Ocho are very simple, you may find them similar to a popular game called Unoâ„¢. While the rules are similar, the gameplay is not.</p>
<h2><a name="baserules">Base Rules</a></h2>
<p>The objective of the game is to have no cards left in your hand at the end of any one turn.</p>
<p>Start by dealing out 7 cards to each player, then place the remaining cards (the Draw Pile) in the middle of the table. Take the top card and place it face-up next to the Draw Pile. First turn goes to the player left of the dealer.</p>
<p>On a player's turn, they must play a card on top of the face-up pile. A card can be played if it matches the suit or rank of the face-up card. If the player is unable to play, they must draw from the Draw Pile until they get a card that they can play. The Draw Pile is replenished by shuffling the pile of played cards, leaving the current top card out of the shuffle (so you don't forget what the drawing player is playing on).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Uno:</strong> When a player is down to a single card, you must say "Uno!" If another player calls "Uno" (after a respectful pause) before the player with one card left, that player must draw four cards.</li>
<li><strong>Stacking:</strong> When the player before you plays a Draw Two, you may avoid drawing two cards if you also play a Draw Two. "Stacking" Draw Twos compound the punishment (a second Draw Two would make the 3rd player draw four cards, unless they continue the stack.) The turn does not end until a player cannot or chooses not to play a 2, and incurs the total penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Stack and Skip:</strong> If a Draw Two is stacked on an identical Draw Two (a 2 of the same suit), the skip occurs first, then the stacking may continue.</li>
<li><strong>The Bomb:</strong> Wild Draw Four is unavoidable. Playing one guarantees that the next player will draw four cards.</li>
<li><strong>Ocho:</strong> When an eight is played, it is encouraged to say "Ocho!"</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="maocho">Maocho</a></h2>
<p>Maocho is a variant of Ocho where players get to add rules to the game. The winner of each hand gets to add (or effectively replace) a rule, that persists until the game is over. The game ends when a hand cannot continue (there are no more cards to draw from and the current player cannot play.) The loser is whomever won the last hand (since they made the rule that finally broke the game). Everyone else wins.</p>
<p>The key to a successful Maocho game is balancing rules that add cards to players' hands, and rules that allow players to remove cards from their hands. As such, it is recommended that one should not seek to make any one card more powerful than a Wild Draw Four.</p>
<p>Not very creative? Here are some play-tested Maocho rules to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chess Rules:</strong> This rule changes the value of face cards so higher ranks are more valuable. Jacks cause the player to draw one after play, potentially avoiding the Draw Pile, but not getting closer to the game's objective. Queens allow the next player to choose the suit, potentially avoiding the Draw Pile but not gaining the tactical advantage of choosing suit. Kings remain full-powered Wilds. <em>This rule is balanced and tame, suitable for early game and when the game is in a balanced state.</em> Variation: Instead of drawing a replacement card on Jacks, the suit only changes to the suit of the Jack. </li>
<li><strong>Threes:</strong> Whenever a 3 (or rank of your choosing) is in your hand, play face-up in front of you. When the Draw Pile is empty and the deck is being shuffled, all players return their 3s into the shuffle. Any players without a 3 suffer a draw one penalty off the top of the replenished Draw Pile. Any player who attempts to play a 3 instead of keeping it draws three (and places the offending card in front of them). <em>This rule is balanced and tame but moderately challenging, good for advanced Ocho players at any point in the game.</em></li>
<li><strong>War:</strong> A rank of card triggers a game of War. The player of the card counts down from three while all players start shuffling their hands face-down. At the end of the countdown, all players flip a card face-up in front of them. Highest card showing takes everyone's cards into their hand. Aces low, Jokers high, ties settled by a run-off (adding extra cards to the punishment). <em>This rule is balanced but brutal, suitable for balanced and penalty-heavy games.</em></li>
<li><strong>Pass Left:</strong> A rank of card causes all players to pass their entire hands to the player to the left. <em>This rule is brutal, and should only be paired with low-frequency ranks in your deck.</em></li>
</ul>
