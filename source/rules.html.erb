<h1>Rules</h1>
<hr class="style-two">
<p>The rules to Ocho are very simple, you may find them similar to a popular game called Uno™. While the rules are similar, the gameplay is not.</p>
<h2><a name="gameplay">Gameplay</a></h2>
<p>The winner of a hand is the first player to have no cards left in their hand at the end of any one turn.</p>
<p>Start by dealing out 7 cards to each player, then place the remaining cards (the Draw Pile) in the middle of the table. Take the top card and place it face-up next to the Draw Pile. First turn goes to the player left of the dealer.</p>
<p>On a player's turn, they must play a card on top of the face-up pile. A card can be played if it matches the suit or rank of the face-up card. If a player does not have a valid card in their hand to play, they add cards to their hand from the Draw Pile <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="However, since hands are secret, players may continue to draw even after they acquire a card that could validly be played.">until they can</span>. If the Draw Pile is empty, it is replenished by shuffling the pile of played cards, <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="So you don't forget what suit and rank the drawing player is playing on.">leaving the current top card out of the shuffle</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="baserules">Starting Rules</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uno:</strong> When a player is down to a single card, you must say "Uno!" If another player calls "Uno" (<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="A player should say &quot;Uno&quot; as they play their penultimate card, but at the very least the moment after they've set the card down. A respectful pause is defined as waiting a beat after the card is played. Calling a player's Uno as they're playing the card (the card is still in their hand) is generally considered bad form, and should not be considered valid.">after a respectful pause</span>) before the player with one card left, that player must draw four cards.</li>
<li><strong>Stacking:</strong> When the player before you plays a Draw Two, you may avoid drawing two cards if you also play a Draw Two. "Stacking" Draw Twos compound the punishment (a second Draw Two would make the 3rd player draw four cards, unless they continue the stack.) <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="Meaning a player doesn't win a hand on a 2 until the stacking is over, in case the draw penalty makes it back around to them!">The turn does not end</span> until a player cannot or chooses not to play a 2, and incurs the total penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Stack and Skip:</strong> If a Draw Two is stacked on an identical Draw Two (a 2 of the same suit), the skip occurs first. Drawing or stacking then continues as normal.</li>
<li><strong>The Bomb:</strong> Wild Draw Four is unavoidable. Playing one guarantees that the next player will draw four cards.</li>
<li><strong>Ocho:</strong> When an eight is played, it is encouraged to say <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="Not for any reason, just because it's really fun.">"Ocho!"</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="strategy">Strategy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Like Uno™, if you can <strong>save a wild card as your last card</strong>, you greatly increase your chances of winning the hand.</li>
<li><strong>Keep an eye on the size of your opponents' hands</strong>. By calling an opponent's Uno, you defuse a potential threat. <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;text-decoration: none;" title="The reverse, however, is not true. Players may 'defend' by hiding the amount of cards in their hand, but if an opponent asks how many cards they have left, they must answer honestly by visibly spreading out the cards in their hand.">The best defense is a good offense</span>!</li>
<li><strong>Collusion</strong> against players who have one card left is not only encouraged, but critical to the game. <strong>Players should openly strategize together</strong> about what cards they can play for each other to result in the player with one card left from winning, by delaying their turn with skips, forcing them to draw, or changing the suit to one they won't be able to play on.</li>
